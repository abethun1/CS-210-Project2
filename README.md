# CS-210-Project2
Banking App that calculates investments based on several pieces of initial data


This project was developed to do calculations on an initial investment to see the potential
 growth that someone would have on their investment over a set number of years at a specified APR. 
The program asks the user for several numbers including the initial investment amount, the APR %, 
and how many years they are going to leave the investment for. A bonus is it also allows the user 
to add an additional field of monthly deposits. The data is then processed and reflected in a table.
 The user then has the option of changing each of those values.

What is well about this code and that I thought was challenging was making sure the user put in 
a correct value for each of the variables being assessed. Also making the table to a specific 
industry standard was not too hard but rewarding when I found the solution and new library in C++.
 Learning to read a company or even another personâ€™s flowchart for UI/UX specifications is something
 that is transferable to multiple industries and is integral to being a good programmer. 

Some improvements I would make would be to take in more variables and figuring out how I can have a
UI/UX that can handle different calculations for other things a user might want to do in a bank, 
such as track a CD (certificate of deposit) versus a savings account or 401k or mutual fund.
